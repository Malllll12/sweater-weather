# SWEATER WEATHER
You are a back-end developer working on a team that is building an application to plan road trips. This app will allow users to see the current weather as well as the forecasted weather at the destination.

Your team is working in a service-oriented architecture. The front-end will communicate with your back-end through an API. Your job is to expose that API that satisfies the front-end teamâ€™s requirements.This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

----------

### Set Up
On your local system, open a terminal session to run the following commands:
1. Clone this repository `$ git clone git@github.com:Malllll12/sweater-weather.git`
2. Navigate to the newly cloned directory `$ cd sweater-weather`
3. If bundler is not installed run `$ gem install bundler`
4. If or after bundler is installed run `$ bundle install` to install the required Gems
5. If errors occur, check for proper installation and versions of `bundler`, `ruby`, and `rails`
6. Set up the database locally with `$ rails db:{:drop,:create,:migrate,:seed}`
7. Open your text editor and check to see that `schema.rb` exists
8. You may also run the RSpec test suite locally with the command `$ bundle exec rspec` to ensure everything is functioning as expected.
